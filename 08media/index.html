            <p>Dairy farming has been around for a long time, so we don't have a certain point in time when it started. However, we know aurochs, <strong>a distant ancestor of cattle</strong>, were first domesticated sometime between 8 and 10,000 years ago. We also know that nomadic cultures across the world have kept several types of grazing animals throughout history, including cattle. Known for their strong leather hide, hearty meat, and nutritious dairy, cattle and their farming are some of the best kept traditions from the ancient world.</p>
            <p>One of the most important things for cattle <a href="location.html#land">is land</a>. <em>Cattle require a lot of land</em> in order to grow and thrive, which is why cattle were often chosen by tribes that traveled often and lived remotely. With this access to land, cattle were able to thrive, even off of simple plants like prarie grasses and weeds.</p>
            <h2>Cattle Facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cattle were brought to the western hemisphere by Christopher Columbus, around the year 1493.</li>
                    <li>Cattle need to sustain off of a diet of mostly grasses, hays, and other plants</li>
                    <li>Cattle come in many shapes, sizes and colors, especially across meat and dairy breeds</li>
                    <li>Cattle are great animals for those who have large amounts of land or who live off the land (like many nomadic tribes did in the ancient world)</li>
                    <li>Cattle have four stomach compartments: rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum</li>
                </ul>
